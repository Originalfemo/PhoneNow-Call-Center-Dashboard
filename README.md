# PhoneNow-Call-Center-Dashboard

This dashboard is part of the PwC virtual Internship and I was tasked with creating a dashboard in Power BI for Claire who is a call center manager at PhoneNow. The dashboard has to reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

The dashboard showed some metrics which includes:

Overall customer satisfaction

Overall calls answered/abandoned

Calls by time

Average speed of answer

Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
